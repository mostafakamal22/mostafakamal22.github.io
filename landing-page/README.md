# the landing page project:

By using `javascript` we can transform ordinary web pages into a **dynamically interactive webpage**.

## After adding js codes to the page I manage to :

1. Build the navigation menu **dynamically**.
2. Add functionality to distinguish the section in view.
3. Add the functionality to scroll to sections.
4. Hide fixed navigation bar while not scrolling.
5. Add `back to top` button.
6. make sections collapsible.
